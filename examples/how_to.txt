To check the supplied examples the following software should be available:
-PHP 7.0 or higher (https://www.php.net/downloads.php)
-Java SE Development Kit 1.7 or higher(https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase7-521261.html)
- Java Bridge (https://sourceforge.net/projects/php-java-bridge/files/Binary%20package/php-java-bridge_7.2.1/exploded/JavaBridge.jar/download)

JavaBridge.jar and Java.inc are the part of Java Bridge and  included to example.

The files which relevant to Java side are collected in folder java_side.
The files which relevant to PHP side are collected in folder php_side.

Launch examples procedure:

1. You can obtain the temporary license file at https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license
and put the license file Aspose.BarCode.PHP.Java.lic to folder lic.
If you launch examples without license the functionality will be partially restricted according with licensing rules.

2. Run JavaBridge server. The easiest way is to launch the script 'run-bridge.bat'.
It will be launched on port 8080. If you wish to change the port number just appoint another port number in 'run-bridge.bat'.

3. You can open file 'how_to_generate_and_read_example.php' and launch it from IDE.
   Another option is to launch command (from inside the folder php_side):
   php -n -dallow_url_include=On how_to_generate_and_read_example.php

4. You can open file 'how_to_generate_barcode_examples.php' and launch it from IDE.
Another option is to launch command:
php -n -dallow_url_include=On how_to_generate_barcode_examples.php

5. You can open file 'how_to_read_barcode_examples.php' and launch it from IDE.
   Another option is to launch command:
   php -n -dallow_url_include=On how_to_read_barcode_examples.php

If you launch JavaBridge on port 8080 you can use statement 'require_once("Java.inc")'.
The file 'Java.inc' should be in the same folder with your php example.
If you're changing port to another then you should use statement
'require_once("http://localhost:8083/JavaBridge/java/Java.inc")'.
The statement 'require_once("http://localhost:8080/JavaBridge/java/Java.inc")' is also acceptable.
